React journey continues, now learning Router.

For some reason I decided I want to get the items using public API. This project would've been hundred times easier
without it, but I'm starting to forget that stuff and I thought this was the perfect project to implement it.

Biggest problems by far was because of the API so I guess it was good I decided to take that approach.
But nothing major.

States and hooks are fairly straight forward and don't cause big problems. Still I do realize that my use of them could
probably be a lot cleaner. Especially all kinds of onChange handlers etc. But I do have pretty good grasp of them, so I guess
it's just a matter of using them again and again and slowly learning the best practices.

My API call function for different Pok√©mon is a horrible mess. But it's partly because the API itself was a mess. (No easy and
simple way of fetching name and picture, had to fetch individual stuff.)

Router is awesome and easy.

The result is not particularly mind blowing, but I never intended it to be. I only did very basic CSS etc., because I wanted to
keep my main focus on the React itself.
